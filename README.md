# auto-type-writer-Angular 5
A simple Attribute Directive for Angular 5 called Auto Type Writer.

## Overview:
- Implemented as an attribute directive for Angular 5.
- since its an attribute directive, it has easy implementation.
- i used setInterval() function (supported by almost all majorly used browsers).
- since javascript engine has a single thread, i used multiple setInterval functions running independently of each other.
